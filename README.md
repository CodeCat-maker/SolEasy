## ðŸ“ƒ Overview

### Technology stack

#### **Frontend**

-   **React**: The user interface is built with React, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
-   **Reactstrap**: Used for UI components to create a visually appealing and user-friendly layout.
-   **Next.js**: Utilized for rapid development of the projectâ€™s main homepage, offering server-side rendering and improved performance for SEO-friendly content delivery.

#### **Backend**

-   **Python & FastAPI**: FastAPI provides a fast, scalable backend framework for handling API requests efficiently.
-   **SQLite**: Lightweight relational database for storing wallet data and transaction history, ideal for quick access and storage.

#### **Security**

-   **Encryption**: Ensures sensitive calculations and wallet data are protected during transit and storage, providing robust protection against unauthorized access.
-   **CORS**: Configured to securely handle cross-origin requests, allowing only authorized domains to interact with the backend API, thus preventing unauthorized access from untrusted sources.
-   **Local Storage (IndexedDB)**: All data is securely stored in the browser's local IndexedDB storage when running locally, ensuring that sensitive data remains on the client side without the need for external storage. This approach enhances data privacy and control, especially for offline use cases.

#### **Deployment**

  \- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for easy scalability and consistent environment setup.
